## Usage Notes for Textual Content

1. **Narrative Flow:** This template prioritizes storytelling over data presentation. The widgets will display the numbers; the text should provide context, trends, and analysis.

2. **Paragraph Structure:** Each section uses 2-4 paragraph blocks that can stand alone as readable prose. This complements visual widgets that show the same data graphically.

3. **Pronoun Usage:** Use gender-neutral language or check candidate names to determine appropriate pronouns (He/She/They).

4. **Reserved Seats:** If `reserved` field is empty, use "General" in writeup. Otherwise, use "SC" or "ST" as applicable.

5. **Number Formatting:** Format large numbers with commas for readability (e.g., 16,364 not 16364) when mentioned in prose.

6. **Party Names:** Use party codes as-is from data (BJP, INC, JD(U), RJD, etc.). Consider expanding full names on first mention if space allows.

7. **Contextual Language:** Use descriptive phrases like:
   - "emerged victorious" / "secured victory" / "won the seat"
   - "defeating" / "besting" / "emerging victorious over"
   - "margin of X votes" / "by a margin of X votes" / "winning by X votes"
   - "stronghold" / "competitive battleground" / "swing constituency"
   - "political stability" / "electoral volatility" / "changing fortunes"

8. **Trend Analysis Language:** Requires interpretive analysis based on patterns:
   - Same party winning 3 times = "stronghold", "consistent dominance", "party loyalty"
   - Different parties winning = "swing seat", "competitive constituency", "changing allegiances"
   - Increasing margins = "strengthening base", "consolidating support", "growing mandate"
   - Decreasing margins = "tightening contest", "competitive race", "erosion of support"
   - Same candidate winning = "personal popularity", "incumbent advantage", "voter loyalty"

9. **Complementary to Widgets:** Remember this text accompanies:
   - Header widget (shows constituency name, district, seat type)
   - Timeline widget (shows visual election history)
   - Historical grid widget (shows 2020/2015/2010 cards)
   - So the text should provide **interpretation and context**, not just repeat the numbers

10. **Length Considerations:** Target 600-900 words for full writeup:
    - Opening: 1 paragraph (~80 words)
    - Current landscape: 1 paragraph (~100 words)
    - Electoral history: 4 paragraphs (~400 words)
    - Trends analysis: 2 paragraphs (~200 words)
    - Looking ahead: 2 paragraphs (~150 words)

## Writing Style Guide

### Do's:
✅ **Narrative:** "The political history of Patna Sahib over the past decade reveals remarkable consistency..."
✅ **Contextual:** "...demonstrating Nand Kishore Yadav's personal popularity and the BJP's organizational strength"
✅ **Analytical:** "These trends suggest that BJP has successfully consolidated its grip..."
✅ **Flow:** Connect paragraphs with transitional phrases
✅ **Varied language:** Use synonyms (won/secured/emerged victorious, defeated/bested/emerged victorious over)

### Don'ts:
❌ **Bullet points:** This is prose, not a list
❌ **Data tables:** The widgets show this visually
❌ **Repetitive structure:** Vary sentence structure across paragraphs
❌ **Raw numbers only:** Always provide interpretation
❌ **Generic templates:** Adapt language to each constituency's unique pattern

## Automation Potential

This textual template can be semi-automated:

**Fully Automated:**
- Field substitution (names, parties, districts, votes, margins)
- Basic conditional logic (if same winner, say "continuity"; if different, say "change")
- Margin comparison (if 2020 > 2015, say "widening"; if <, say "tightening")

**Requires Manual Editing:**
- Contextual phrases ("urban/rural", "capital city", "traditional stronghold")
- Trend interpretation beyond simple patterns
- District-level context and alliance dynamics
- "Looking ahead" section with political nuance

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Generate base text with field substitution
2. Add programmatic trend detection (margins, party changes)
3. Manual review for 10-20% of constituencies to add rich context
4. Use those reviewed versions as templates for similar patterns
5. Final editorial pass for tone and flow

**Tools:**
- Python + Jinja2 for template population
- GPT-4/Claude API for contextual paragraph generation
- Bulk export to 243 markdown files
- CMS import via API or manual paste

This enables quick generation while maintaining quality through selective manual enhancement.
